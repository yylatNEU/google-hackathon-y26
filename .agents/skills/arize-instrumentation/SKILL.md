description: Adds Arize AX tracing to an LLM application for the first time. Follows a two-phase agent-assisted flow to analyze the codebase then implement instrumentation after user confirmation. Use when the user wants to instrument their app, add tracing from scratch, set up LLM observability, integrate OpenTelemetry or openinference, or get started with Arize tracing.
metadata:
  author: arize
  version: "1.0"
compatibility: Python and TypeScript/JavaScript apps use openinference-instrumentation packages for auto-instrumentation. Go apps use arize-otel-go for setup plus per-provider instrumentors openinference-instrumentation-openai-go (official openai/openai-go SDK) and openinference-instrumentation-anthropic-sdk-go (anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go), or manual spans via openinference-semantic-conventions. Java apps use the OpenTelemetry SDK with manual OpenInference spans. See https://arize.com/docs/PROMPT.md for setup details.

# Arize Instrumentation Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to **add Arize AX tracing** to their application. Follow the **two-phase, agent-assisted flow** from the [Agent-Assisted Tracing Setup](https://arize.com/docs/ax/alyx/tracing-assistant) and the [Arize AX Tracing — Agent Setup Prompt](https://arize.com/docs/PROMPT.md).

## Quick start (for the user)

If the user asks you to "set up tracing" or "instrument my app with Arize", you can start with:

> Follow the instructions from https://arize.com/docs/PROMPT.md and ask me questions as needed.

Then execute the two phases below.

## Core principles

- **Prefer inspection over mutation** — understand the codebase before changing it.
- **Do not change business logic** — tracing is purely additive.
- **Use auto-instrumentation where available** — add manual spans only for custom logic not covered by integrations.
- **Follow existing code style** and project conventions.
- **Keep output concise and production-focused** — do not generate extra documentation or summary files.
- **NEVER embed literal credential values in generated code** — always reference environment variables (e.g., `os.environ["ARIZE_API_KEY"]`, `process.env.ARIZE_API_KEY`). This includes API keys, space IDs, and any other secrets. The user sets these in their own environment; the agent must never output raw secret values.

## Phase 0: Environment preflight

Before changing code:

1. Confirm the repo/service scope is clear. For monorepos, do not assume the whole repo should be instrumented.
2. Identify the local runtime surface you will need for verification:
   - package manager and app start command
   - whether the app is long-running, server-based, or a short-lived CLI/script
   - whether `ax` will be needed for post-change verification
3. Do NOT proactively check `ax` installation or version. If `ax` is needed for verification later, just run it when the time comes. If it fails, see references/ax-profiles.md.
4. Never silently replace a user-provided space ID, project name, or project ID. If the CLI, collector, and user input disagree, surface that mismatch as a concrete blocker.

## Phase 1: Analysis (read-only)

**Do not write any code or create any files during this phase.**

### Steps

1. **Check dependency manifests** to detect stack:
   - Python: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`
   - TypeScript/JavaScript: `package.json`
   - Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`
   - Go: `go.mod`

2. **Scan import statements** in source files to confirm what is actually used.

3. **Check for existing tracing/OTel** — look for `TracerProvider`, `register()`, `opentelemetry` imports, `ARIZE_*`, `OTEL_*`, `OTLP_*` env vars, or other observability config (Datadog, Honeycomb, etc.).

4. **Identify scope** — for monorepos or multi-service projects, ask which service(s) to instrument.

### What to identify

| Item | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Language | Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Go |
| Package manager | pip/poetry/uv, npm/pnpm/yarn, maven/gradle, go modules |
| LLM providers | OpenAI, Anthropic, LiteLLM, Bedrock, etc. |
| Frameworks | LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Vercel AI SDK, Mastra, etc. |
| Existing tracing | Any OTel or vendor setup |
| Tool/function use | LLM tool use, function calling, or custom tools the app executes (e.g. in an agent loop) |

**Key rule:** When a framework is detected alongside an LLM provider, inspect the framework-specific tracing docs first and prefer the framework-native integration path when it already captures the model and tool spans you need. Add separate provider instrumentation only when the framework docs require it or when the framework-native integration leaves obvious gaps. If the app runs tools and the framework integration does not emit tool spans, add manual TOOL spans so each invocation appears with input/output (see references/manual-spans.md).

### Phase 1 output

Return a concise summary:

- Detected language, package manager, providers, frameworks
- Proposed integration list (from the routing table in the docs)
- Any existing OTel/tracing that needs consideration
- If monorepo: which service(s) you propose to instrument
- **If the app uses LLM tool use / function calling:** note that you will add manual CHAIN + TOOL spans so each tool call appears in the trace with input/output (avoids sparse traces).

If the user explicitly asked you to instrument the app now, and the target service is already clear, present the Phase 1 summary briefly and continue directly to Phase 2. If scope is ambiguous, or the user asked for analysis first, stop and wait for confirmation.

## Integration routing and docs

Use the [Agent Setup Prompt](https://arize.com/docs/PROMPT.md) routing table to map detected signals to integration docs and fetch the matched pages for exact installation steps and code snippets. Use [llms.txt](https://arize.com/docs/llms.txt) as a fallback for doc discovery.

See references/integration-routing.md for the full list of supported integrations by language and platform.

## Phase 2: Implementation

Proceed **only after the user confirms** the Phase 1 analysis.

### Steps

1. **Fetch integration docs** — Read the matched doc URLs and follow their installation and instrumentation steps.
2. **Install packages** using the detected package manager **before** writing code:
   - Python: `pip install arize-otel` plus `openinference-instrumentation-{name}` (hyphens in package name; underscores in import, e.g. `openinference.instrumentation.llama_index`).
   - TypeScript/JavaScript: `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node` plus the relevant `@arizeai/openinference-*` package.
   - Java: OpenTelemetry SDK plus `openinference-instrumentation-*` in pom.xml or build.gradle.
   - Go: Use [`arize-otel-go`](https://github.com/Arize-ai/arize-otel-go) for tracer setup, plus a per-provider instrumentor when one exists. Install:
     ```
     go get github.com/Arize-ai/arize-otel-go
     go get github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/go/openinference-semantic-conventions
     go get github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/go/openinference-instrumentation
     # Plus exactly one of these, matched to the detected client:
     go get github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/go/openinference-instrumentation-openai-go        # official openai/openai-go SDK
     go get github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/go/openinference-instrumentation-anthropic-sdk-go # anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go v1.43+
     ```
     **Wire the exporter** with one call: `arizeotel.Register(ctx, arizeotel.Options{ProjectName: "my-app"})` — defaults to `otlp.arize.com` (US), use `arizeotel.EndpointArizeEurope` for EU. It reads `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` / `ARIZE_API_KEY` / `ARIZE_PROJECT_NAME` / `ARIZE_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` from env when the matching `Options` fields are unset. **Wire the OpenAI instrumentor** by passing `option.WithMiddleware(openaiotel.Middleware(otel.Tracer("my-app")))` to `openai.NewClient(...)` (alongside `option.WithAPIKey(...)`). **Wire the Anthropic instrumentor** by passing `option.WithMiddleware(anthropicotel.Middleware(otel.Tracer("my-app")))` to `anthropic.NewClient(...)`. Both instrumentors expose `WithTraceConfig(instrumentation.TraceConfig{...})` for in-code overrides of the `OPENINFERENCE_HIDE_*` env-driven masking config. Module floor is Go 1.25 (the openinference Go modules require it; `arize-otel-go` itself is Go 1.23+).
3. **Credentials** — User needs an **Arize API Key** and **Space ID**. Check existing `ax` profiles for `ARIZE_API_KEY` and `ARIZE_SPACE` — never read `.env` files:
   - Run `ax profiles show` to check for an existing profile.
   - If no profile exists, guide the user to run `ax profiles create` which provides an **interactive wizard** that walks through API key and space setup. See [CLI profiles docs](https://arize.com/docs/api-clients/cli/profiles) for details.
   - If the user needs to find their API key manually, direct them to **https://app.arize.com** and to navigate to the settings page (do not use organization-specific URLs with placeholder IDs — they won't resolve for new users).
   - If credentials are not set, instruct the user to set them as environment variables — never embed raw values in generated code. All generated instrumentation code must reference `os.environ["ARIZE_API_KEY"]` / `os.environ["ARIZE_SPACE"]` (Python), `process.env.ARIZE_API_KEY` / `process.env.ARIZE_SPACE` (TypeScript/JavaScript), or `os.Getenv("ARIZE_API_KEY")` / `os.Getenv("ARIZE_SPACE_ID")` (Go — `arize-otel-go` reads `ARIZE_SPACE_ID`, not `ARIZE_SPACE`). With the recommended `arizeotel.Register(ctx, arizeotel.Options{...})` flow, generated Go code does not need to call `os.Getenv` at all — `Register` reads both env vars when the matching `Options` fields are unset.
   - See references/ax-profiles.md for full profile setup and troubleshooting.
4. **Centralized instrumentation** — Create a single module (e.g. `instrumentation.py`, `instrumentation.ts`, `instrumentation.go`) and initialize tracing **before** any LLM client is created.
5. **Existing OTel** — If there is already a TracerProvider, add Arize as an **additional** exporter (e.g. BatchSpanProcessor with Arize OTLP). Do not replace existing setup unless the user asks.

### Implementation rules

- Use **auto-instrumentation first**; manual spans only when needed.
- Prefer the repo's native integration surface before adding generic OpenTelemetry plumbing. If the framework ships an exporter or observability package, use that first unless there is a documented gap.
- **Fail gracefully** if env vars are missing (warn, do not crash).
- **Import order:** register tracer → attach instrumentors → then create LLM clients.
- **Project name attribute (required):** Arize rejects spans with HTTP 500 if the project name is missing — `service.name` alone is not accepted. Set it as a **resource attribute** on the TracerProvider (recommended — one place, applies to all spans):
  - **Python:** `register(project_name="my-app")` handles it automatically (sets `"openinference.project.name"` on the resource). For routing spans to different projects, use `set_routing_context(space_id=..., project_name=...)` from `arize.otel`.
  - **TypeScript:** Arize accepts both `"model_id"` (shown in the official TS quickstart) and `"openinference.project.name"` via `SEMRESATTRS_PROJECT_NAME` from `@arizeai/openinference-semantic-conventions` (shown in the manual instrumentation docs) — both work.
  - **Go:** `arizeotel.Register(ctx, arizeotel.Options{ProjectName: "my-app"})` handles this automatically (sets `openinference.project.name` and `service.name` on the resource). If you're wiring `sdktrace.NewTracerProvider` directly (multi-exporter, on-prem collector), pass `attribute.String("openinference.project.name", "my-app")` to `resource.New(...)` manually.
- **CLI/script apps — flush before exit:** `provider.shutdown()` (TS) / `provider.force_flush()` then `provider.shutdown()` (Python) / `tp.Shutdown(ctx)` (Go) must be called before the process exits, otherwise async OTLP exports are dropped and no traces appear.
- **When the app has tool/function execution:** add manual CHAIN + TOOL spans (see references/manual-spans.md) so the trace tree shows each tool call and its result — otherwise traces will look sparse (only LLM API spans, no tool input/output).

## Verification

Treat instrumentation as complete only when all of the following are true:

1. The app still builds or typechecks after the tracing change.
2. The app starts successfully with the new tracing configuration.
3. You trigger at least one real request or run that should produce spans.
4. You either verify the resulting trace in Arize, or you provide a precise blocker that distinguishes app-side success from Arize-side failure.

After implementation:

1. Run the application and trigger at least one LLM call.
2. **Use the `arize-trace` skill** to confirm traces arrived. If empty, retry shortly. Verify spans have expected `openinference.span.kind`, `input.value`/`output.value`, and parent-child relationships.
3. If no traces: verify `ARIZE_SPACE` and `ARIZE_API_KEY`, ensure tracer is initialized before instrumentors and clients, check connectivity to `otlp.arize.com:443`, and inspect app/runtime exporter logs so you can tell whether spans are being emitted locally but rejected remotely. For debug set `GRPC_VERBOSITY=debug` or pass `log_to_console=True` to `register()`. Common gotchas: (a) missing project name resource attribute causes HTTP 500 rejections — `service.name` alone is not enough; Python: pass `project_name` to `register()`; TypeScript: set `"model_id"` or `SEMRESATTRS_PROJECT_NAME` on the resource; Go: add `attribute.String("openinference.project.name", "my-app")` to `resource.New(...)`; (b) CLI/script processes exit before OTLP exports flush — call `provider.force_flush()` then `provider.shutdown()` (Python/TS) or `tp.Shutdown(ctx)` (Go) before exit; (c) CLI-visible spaces/projects can disagree with a collector-targeted space ID — report the mismatch instead of silently rewriting credentials.
4. If the app uses tools: confirm CHAIN and TOOL spans appear with `input.value` / `output.value` so tool calls and results are visible.

When verification is blocked by CLI or account issues, end with a concrete status:

- app instrumentation status
- latest local trace ID or run ID
- whether exporter logs show local span emission
- whether the failure is credential, space/project resolution, network, or collector rejection
